Udacity Front End Nanodegree - Project 4: Website Optimization

Optimization of index.html

1. Use Web Font Loader asynchronously

2. Inline css/style.css

3. Add a media query for print.css

4. make google-analytics script async

5. reduce the size of the pizzaria.jpg

6. compress all images in img directory


Optimization of view/js/main.js

1. Modified the changePizzaSizes function to select randomPizzaContainer by class name

2. Moved the variable dx and newwidth outside of the loop to avoid iterating through each time the loop runs.

3. Moved the variable pizzasDiv outside of the loop

4. Modified the updatePositions function to select mover elements by class name

5. Moved the phase calculation into its own for loop the appends each phase to an array

6. Pizza item styles are changed by accessing the relevant element of the phaseList array

7. Changed the number of pizzas generated to be based on the window height

8. Changed querySelector call to getElementById outside of the loop and saved this DOM call to local variable

9. Changed querySelector to getElementByID in the changeSliderLabel

10. Saved array length in a local variable, so array's length property is not accessed to check its value at each iteration

11. Declared elem variable in the initialisation of the for loop  will prevent it from being create every time the loop is executed

12. added backface-visibility: hidden;transform: translateZ(0); to CSS

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
